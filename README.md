# AWS SageMaker Language Model Fine-tuning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning a language model using AWS SageMaker. The goal is to configure the project environment, fine-tune a pre-trained model, and evaluate its performance in generating text within a specified domain. The project utilizes AWS SageMaker, Jupyter Notebook, and various AWS services to accomplish these tasks.

## Technologies
- AWS SageMaker
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- PyTorch/TensorFlow
- AWS IAM

## Libraries
- PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Tools
- AWS Console
- JupyterLab
- GitHub

## Project Workflow
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure AWS SageMaker IAM role, create a SageMaker Notebook instance, and request GPU instance for training.
2. **Project Initialization**: Upload project starter files to the SageMaker Notebook instance.
3. **Dataset Selection**: Choose a domain (Financial, IT, Healthcare/Medical) for the model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Deploy and evaluate the initial model's text generation capabilities.
5. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the model to enhance its performance within the selected domain.
6. **Fine-tuned Model Evaluation**: Deploy and evaluate the fine-tuned model's text generation capabilities.

## Project Objectives
- Configure AWS SageMaker environment for language model fine-tuning.
- Train and fine-tune a pre-trained language model.
- Deploy the model for text generation within a specific domain.
- Evaluate model performance and document findings.
- Submit project documentation and files for assessment.

## Domain Expert Model
- The project allows selecting a domain of expertise for the language model, including Financial, IT, or Healthcare/Medical.
- The chosen domain informs the fine-tuning process, tailoring the model's understanding and generation capabilities to the selected field.

## Uses
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Model fine-tuning and deployment
- AWS SageMaker services
- Project documentation and submission
